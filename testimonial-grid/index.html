          I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were
          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I
          got every penny's worth.

          looking to make a transition and have heard some people who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next 12
          weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I've successfully switched careers, working as
          a Software Engineer at a VR startup."
